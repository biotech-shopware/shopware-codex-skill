# Context and Commerce

## Context Types

- Use `SalesChannelContext` for storefront and Store API behavior.
- Use `Context` with `AdminApiSource` for Admin API work.
- Use system context for CLI, workers, and background processes only when that scope is appropriate.
- Do not create `Context::createDefaultContext()` in storefront flows and assume pricing, visibility, currency, or customer state will still be correct.

Example:
- storefront request
  Use `SalesChannelContext`, then extract `getContext()` only for DAL operations.
- admin write
  Verify admin source and ACL expectations instead of reusing storefront context logic.

## Sales Channel Awareness

- Respect `salesChannelId`, language, currency, customer group, and tax state in customer-facing logic.
- Enforce ownership and channel boundaries server-side for saved customer data, tokens, and account operations.
- Enforce the same ownership rules for subscriptions, saved payment methods, subscription addresses, line items, and provider-specific card-choice mappings.
- Do not assume one storefront, one language, or one price context.
- If shipping methods, catalogs, or prices vary for roles such as sales agents or B2B segments, enforce that in backend resolution and route validation, not only in Twig visibility.

## Pricing and Tax

- Keep pricing logic aware of currency, tax state, rule evaluation, and customer group.
- Avoid computing or caching prices outside the correct sales-channel scope.
- Recalculate recurring-order totals, shipping, and payment context from the active or reconstructed sales-channel context instead of reusing stale original transaction assumptions.
- Treat external tax integrations as hot-path risks and apply the same timeout and fallback rules used elsewhere in checkout.

Example patterns:

```php
// Bad: storefront flow falls back to default context and loses real pricing scope
$context = Context::createDefaultContext();
$product = $this->productRepository->search(new Criteria([$productId]), $context)->first();
```

```php
// Preferred: keep the sales-channel context authoritative and only extract DAL context where needed
$product = $this->productRepository->search(
    new Criteria([$productId]),
    $salesChannelContext->getContext()
)->first();
```

```text
Bad: reuse the original subscription order total after the customer changes address, shipping method, or tax context.
Good: rebuild or recalculate in the active sales-channel context before charging or persisting the renewal.
```

## B2B and Organization-Sensitive Logic

- When a project has company accounts, roles, approval flows, or budget logic, keep those boundaries explicit instead of overloading standard customer assumptions.
- Do not let a single customer-level shortcut bypass channel, role, or organization checks.
