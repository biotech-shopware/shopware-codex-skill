# Source Hierarchy

## Authority Order

1. Official Shopware docs for the exact target version.
2. Stable Shopware core behavior matching the project version.
3. Official Symfony docs.
4. This skill's distilled references.

For storefront accessibility questions, use this variant:

1. Official Shopware docs for the exact target version.
2. Stable Shopware core storefront behavior matching the project version.
3. WCAG 2.2, WAI-ARIA APG, ADA.gov, and U.S. Access Board material when the question is accessibility-specific.
4. Official Symfony docs when framework behavior matters to the implementation.
5. This skill's distilled references.

## Ownership Boundaries

Keep each concern in one place:

- Workflow and loading rules belong in `SKILL.md` and `03-implementation-workflow.md`.
- Version splits belong in `02-version-targeting.md`.
- General plugin and project backend rules belong in `04-plugin-backend.md`.
- Compact storefront, Twig, JS, SCSS, theme, SEO, and implementation-level accessibility rules belong in `05-storefront-and-themes.md`.
- Deep accessibility standards, WCAG-oriented audit heuristics, and storefront compliance review patterns belong in `17-accessibility-and-template-best-practices.md`.
- Administration modules, app extensions, and admin migration guidance belong in `06-administration-and-apps.md`.
- Payment-only rules belong in `07-payments.md`.
- Review/audit rules belong in `08-analysis-and-reviews.md`.
- Symfony/PHP baseline rules belong in `09-symfony-and-php.md`.
- Official links belong in `10-official-docs-map.md`.
- Security baseline, observability, testing, store-readiness, and common plugin failure patterns belong in `11-quality-and-operations.md`.
- Configuration, Flow Builder triggers, CMS patterns, import/export, media, and Rule Builder belong in `12-extension-patterns.md`.
- Context handling, multichannel behavior, pricing, and sales-channel-aware logic belong in `13-context-and-commerce.md`.
- Console commands and development tooling belong in `14-cli-and-dev-tooling.md`.
- Subscription lifecycle and recurring-commerce orchestration belong in `15-subscriptions-and-recurring-payments.md`.
- Headless or composable frontend payment and trust-boundary rules belong in `16-headless-and-composable-frontends.md`.
- Cart, checkout, delivery, line item, and promotion pipeline rules belong in `18-cart-and-checkout-pipeline.md`.
- Shopware-specific testing patterns belong in `19-testing-patterns.md`.
- Search, Elasticsearch, and OpenSearch rules belong in `20-search-and-indexing.md`.
- Snippet, translation, and localization rules belong in `21-internationalization-and-snippets.md`.

Do not repeat the same rule in multiple files unless the split would otherwise hide a critical safety boundary. Use short cross-references instead.

## Ownership Examples

Use these examples to decide where a new learning belongs:

| New learning | Primary owner | Keep elsewhere |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `searchIds()` versus `search()` in DAL loops | `04-plugin-backend.md` | short cross-reference from `18` when the loop is inside cart logic |
| collector versus processor responsibilities | `18-cart-and-checkout-pipeline.md` | short cross-reference from `04` or `07` |
| Store API functional test with `SalesChannelApiTestBehaviour` | `19-testing-patterns.md` | short cross-reference from `11` |
| extending Elasticsearch product mapping and fetch logic together | `20-search-and-indexing.md` | short cross-reference from `04` |
| `messages.en.base.json` and admin/storefront snippet ownership | `21-internationalization-and-snippets.md` | short cross-reference from `05` or `06` |
| detailed PR template or findings template | `03-implementation-workflow.md` or `08-analysis-and-reviews.md` | no duplicate second owner |

Apply repo-local `AGENTS.md` guidance only when the repo already uses it or the user explicitly asks for it.
